## Climate Data Sonification

This project explores data sonification as an alternative way to understand climate change by converting global temperature anomaly data (1958–2024) into music.

### Dataset
- Source: NASA GISS Global Climate Indicators
- Variable: Annual Mean Global Temperature Anomaly

### Sonification Mapping
- Time → Rhythm (each year = one note)
- Temperature → Pitch (scaled between C4 and C6)
- Tempo: 60 BPM
- Timbre: Piano-like MIDI sound

### Files
- `MATHS.py` – Python code for data sonification
- `Mapping Key.pdf` – Mapping rules and explanation
- `climate_music.mp3` – Generated audio output

### Tools
Python, Pandas, MIDIUtil
